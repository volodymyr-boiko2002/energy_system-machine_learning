# Energy System Control with Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic

## Overview
This Python program implements an energy system control algorithm using neural networks and fuzzy logic. The system aims to optimize the brightness level of lighting in a room based on input data regarding natural light levels and user demand for brightness. It combines machine learning techniques with fuzzy logic control to dynamically adjust the lighting brightness in response to changing environmental conditions and user preferences.

## Features
- Utilizes a neural network model to predict optimal lighting brightness levels.
- Integrates fuzzy logic control to adjust predicted brightness levels based on natural light levels and user demand.
- Provides visualization of the control process through graphical output.
- Offers flexibility for further customization and extension.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed (`pip install numpy scikit-fuzzy tensorflow matplotlib`).
3. Run the `main.py` file to execute the program.

## Usage
1. Modify the input parameters as needed in the `main.py` file.
2. Run the program to train the neural network model and control the energy system.
3. View the graphical output to analyze the control process and results.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
